					<p class="text-length">At Roselind Wilson Design we believe that luxury interior design is about harmony and enhancement, bringing a breath of fresh air to a space and reflecting the individuality of the client. We understand that the world of interior design has evolved and today’s clients showcase a lot more personality. Through the Internet and platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest, clients are savvy, know what they want and have a well-defined sense of style. We respect this and believe that the interior spaces we create are an extension of the people we create them for. We never forget that a design project is a personal journey, a journey to travel alongside our clients, getting to know them, their personal tastes and the way they live.</p>

					<p class="text-length">Listening and meeting clients face to face is the most important first step as it allows us to get to know one another and establish a good rapport. This understanding provides a solid foundation to interpret and assess the client brief and base for our initial design research. Understanding the essence of a project is where Ros’ talent truly lies. Driven by intuition, her innovative approach and ability to capture a clients’ vision is unique. Her eye for detail along with a superior sense of quality effortlessly brings colours, textures, fabrics, furniture and interior architecture together resulting in harmonious designs.</p>

					<p class="text-length">As the design journey evolves, concept images, finishes and interior layouts are developed, presented and discussed in detail with the team and the client every step of the way. Design schemes are communicated through detailed and extremely accurate 3D renders allowing visualisation of the space in context with the proposed design.</p>
					 
					<p class="text-length">As well as the creative side, projects require an enormous amount of coordination, processing of tasks, feedback and instructions, which is why we have rigid internal processes in place to ensure nothing falls through the net. Running 10 steps ahead of our clients and contractors ensures that we can pre-empt any challenges that may occur, trouble-shoot and resolve them quickly and efficiently and pave the way for an impeccable result – the luxurious and beautiful home envisioned by our clients.</p>

					<p class="text-length">Interior architecture is about the interaction between people and space, the optimal flow of a space along with its functionality. At Roselind Wilson Design, we produce creative design solutions that optimise a space to create a better environment to live, work and just be. By constantly scrutinising design options and exchanging ideas within our highly skilled team, we believe our results capture the balance of user experience with perfect functionality, ultimately resulting in a luxurious yet comfortable home.</p>

					<p class="text-length">Our team of interior architects provide a full turnkey service for our clients, from structural changes and full refurbishments to the design and detailing of every interior architectural element. We also offer a full kitchen and bathroom design service and review of all interior architectural details.</p>

					<p class="text-length">Our team is experienced in conducting site surveys, producing and submitting planning applications with the local council and collating full drawing packages for tender. We represent our clients throughout the tender process including the analysis of applications. We then present our findings in a comprehensive format, to assist our clients with their decision on the successful tender. Attending regular CPD (Continuous Professional Development) programmes keeps our knowledge and skills up to date and we are also certified in the new CDM (Construction Design Management) regulations, which includes Health and Safety and the role of the Principle Designer when administrating a building contract. Where required, we work with building control and English Heritage. Our consolidated service also extends to project coordination allowing a completely seamless package for our clients.</p>
